A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small, iconic image that represents a website or web page. It is typically displayed in the browser tab, bookmark bar, or history list next to the page's title. Favicons help users easily identify and locate their favorite sites and enhance the branding and professionalism of a website.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Page with Favicon</title>
    <!-- Link to the favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

    <h1>Welcome to the Example Page</h1>
    <p>This page has a favicon!</p>
</body>
</html>



Key Points:
File Format:

Favicons are commonly in .ico format, but modern browsers also support .png, .gif, and .svg formats. For compatibility, .ico is often used.
File Location:

The href attribute in the <link> tag should point to the location of your favicon file. It can be placed in the root directory or a subdirectory.
Link Tags:

<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">: This is the standard way to link to a favicon.
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">: This is an older method but still widely supported for backward compatibility.
Example Favicon File
To create a favicon, you can use an image editing tool to design a small 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixel image. Save it as favicon.ico and upload it to your web server.

Conclusion
Favicons are a small but important element of website design. They contribute to a cohesive user experience by providing a recognizable visual identity for your site, making it easier for users to find and navigate to your page.
